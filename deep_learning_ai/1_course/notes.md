# Supervised Learning
x (input) --> y (output label)
learns from being given right answers
x is input, y is the answer.

### Regression
- predict number based on inputs
- many different numbers to choose from
- ex: pick house price based on square footage

### Classification 
different: trying to predict small # of categories
- ex: 0, or 1 (true or false)
- Put them into categories
classes & categories are same thing




# Unsupervised Learning
Not given labels Y
algorithm finds something interesting in unlabled data
ask algorithm, what can you find that is intersting

### Clustering
puts data into several clusters
here's a bunch of data, find structure in the data
ex: grouping customers
