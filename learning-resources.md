### AI suggested:
- Refresh Alebra 2. Learn Trig khan academy
- Start with Mathematics for Machine Learning.
    - You‚Äôll understand the math behind algorithms, which will help you appreciate the ML Specialization better.

- Follow with the Machine Learning Specialization.
    - By then, you‚Äôll have the math skills to fully grasp the course‚Äôs content and apply it effectively.

- Use supplementary resources (e.g., Kaggle, TensorFlow tutorials) for practical experience.


#### 1: Algebra 2 refresher
- Equations and inequalities.
- Functions and their graphs (linear, quadratic, exponential).
- Polynomials and factoring.
- Systems of equations.


#### 2: Khan Academy Trig
- Focus on:
    - The unit circle.
    - Sine, cosine, tangent, and their graphs.
    - Radians and degrees.
    - Right triangle relationships and SOH-CAH-TOA.
    - Basic identities (e.g., sin ‚Å° 2 ( ùë•) + cos ‚Å° 2 ( ùë•) = 1 sin 2 (x)+cos 2 (x)=1).  [Khan Academy course: Trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry)

#### 3: Start with Mathematics for Machine Learning (MML):
- The course is designed to be approachable, even for those who haven't used math in a while.
- It includes introductory material to help refresh your memory on linear algebra, calculus, and probability as needed.
- The focus is on applied math, so it‚Äôs more practical and directly relevant to ML.

Supplement with Khan Academy (if needed):
- If you struggle with concepts in the MML course, use Khan Academy for targeted learning:
    - Algebra Refresher:
        - Core Topics: Equations, functions, and graphing basics.
            - Khan Academy sections: Algebra Basics or Algebra II (skim, only dive into weak areas).
    - Trigonometry:
        - Core Topics: Sine, cosine, tangent, and unit circle.
        - This will help with understanding functions and vectors.
    - Basic Calculus:
        - Core Topics: Derivatives and integrals.
        - MML introduces these concepts, but a quick Khan Academy review can help if needed.
